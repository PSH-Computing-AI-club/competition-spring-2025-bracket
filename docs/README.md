## Practice Tournament Brackets

During the practice tournament brackets period an automated system will pull in your code every day, six times a day. Your AI player will compete against every other competitor's AI player without input from you.

When the practice brackets go live you will be able to find the published results at [`PSH-Computing-AI-club.github.io/competition-spring-2025-bracket`](https://PSH-Computing-AI-club.github.io/competition-spring-2025-bracket).
